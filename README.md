## About
I am a [Certified Associate Data Scientist](https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DSA0013045162178) with strong expertise in Python programming, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. With multiple certifications from platforms like [DataCamp]((https://www.datacamp.com/certificate/DSA0013045162178)), Arewa Data Science Academy, and [Coursera](https://coursera.org/share/f19f408c459a83601afd94498af84217), I combine technical prowess with creativity to solve real-world problems.

Currently pursuing a degree in Automotive Engineering, I bring a unique blend of analytical and engineering skills to the table, constantly exploring ways to merge advanced computing with automotive innovation. My academic background enhances my ability to approach challenges from a multidisciplinary perspective, particularly in areas like predictive maintenance, autonomous systems, and data-driven decision-making.

I am passionate about:

Building data-driven solutions for impactful results.
Innovating at the intersection of technology and engineering.
Sharing knowledge and empowering others through tech education.

With over 3 practical projects in Python and Machine Learning, I have honed my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and artificial intelligence. Whether it's cleaning messy datasets, building machine learning models, or training neural networks, I thrive on turning data into actionable insights.
